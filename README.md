# Lavarini et al. [2018a]

Packages that are designed to quantify zircon mixing proportion of source units in river sediments and to compare U-Pb age distributions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3.x.

### Installing

1. Clone or download our repository into your local machine.

2. Add your path to Python interpreter:
```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.append('paste the path here')
```

Use import to have the packages in your Python shell.
```
>>> import sys zAGES, pABRASIONmodel
```

## Running the tests

There are 9 function divided in two packages (zAGES and pABRASIONmodel). 
To access the functions' names, run:

```
>>> dir(module's name) 
```

To know what each function does and the file extensions needed to perform the calculations, run:

```
>>> help(function)
```
    
### Examples

A folder ('examples') available in this repository shows how we used these functions
in our research paper. 

There is also a text file ('variables_in_detail') explaining the structure of files required to run the code correctly. 

All these examples can be assessed through the cloned/downloaded repositories in your local machine.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/) - Python 3.x.
