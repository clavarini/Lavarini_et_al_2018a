Packages that are desgined to quantify zircon mixing proportions of source units in river sediments and to compare U-Pb age distributions.

In this project, we provide packages that are desgined to quantify zircon 
mixing proportions of different source units in modern river sediments and to 
compare U-Pb age distributions deconvolved from zircons.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3.x.

### Installing

Clone or download our repositoty into your local machine.

Add your path to Python interpreter.
```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.append('paste the path here')```

Use import to have the packages in your Python shell.
>>> import sys zAGES, pABRASIONmodel
```

## Running the tests

There almost 9 function divided in two packages (zAGES, pABRASIONmodel). 
To access the functions' names, run:

```
>>> dir(module's name) 
```

To know what each function does, run:

```
>>> help(function)
```
    
### Examples

A folder (Examples) has a series of code showing how we used the functions
in our research paper and it can be assessed through the cloned/downloaded
reposotories you have in your local machine.

```
Open 'Figure3.py', 'Figure4.py' and 'Figure5.py' in your Python console to see the script 
used to generate  the figure 3 of our paper.

```

## Versioning

We use GitHub for versioning (https://github.com/clavarini/Lavarini et al.[2018a]).
