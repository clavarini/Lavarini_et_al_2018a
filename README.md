# Lavarini et al. [2018a]

Packages that are designed to quantify zircon mixing proportions of source units in river sediments and to compare U-Pb age distributions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3.x.

### Installing

1. Clone or download our repository into your local machine.

2. Add your path to Python interpreter:
```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.append('paste the path here')```
```

Use import to have the packages in your Python shell.
```
>>> import sys zAGES, pABRASIONmodel
```

## Running the tests

There are 9 function divided in two packages (zAGES and pABRASIONmodel). 
To access the functions' names, run:

```
>>> dir(module's name) 
```

To know what each function does and the file extensions needed to perform the calculations, run:

```
>>> help(function)
```
    
### Examples

A folder available in this repository has a series of examples showing how we used the functions
in our research paper. 

There are also examples of files that are required to run the experiments correctly. 

All files can be assessed through the cloned/downloaded repositories in your local machine.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/) - Python 3.x.
